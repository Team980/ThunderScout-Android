# ThunderScout: Scout with power [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Team980/ThunderScout-Android.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Team980/ThunderScout-Android)

ThunderScout is an app for FIRST Robotics Competition teams to facilitate the scouting process at competition events. Created by FRC Team 980 Thunderbots, ThunderScout is made to help you get your job done, simpler and faster.

###Designed from the beginning for the user experience
From the scouting process to post-match analysis, ThunderScout has been designed with the end user experience as a top priority. 
The development process has integrated user testing and feedback into the design process to guarantee that the interface is simple and easy to understand, and the app's quantatative, objective, and detailed dataset gives you all the information you need to make your decisions.

###Adjustable to fit any scouting team
ThunderScout is robust, modular, and makes no assumptions. It can be configured to suit a wide array of hardware configurations, and data transfer can be scheduled automatically or be triggered at will. With this many different options for configuration, you'll definitely be able to build a scouting system that's a perfect fit for your team.

###Integrates with third party services
ThunderScout has been built from the ground up to seamlessly integrate with third-party services. You can instantly export your data to a CSV file that you can send to your computer and view in whatever program you like,  whether it's a spreadsheet viewer, cutting-edge data visualization software, or a custom application built by your team. Integration with multiple online services is also included - with Google Sheets synchronization in development and other integrations soon to follow, ThunderScout will give you all the tools you need to get your data where it needs to go.

###Built with the community in mind
Since the very beginning ThunderScout has been developed with the community at the forefront. An open beta on Chief Delphi, the leading FRC community forum, enabled interested participants to engage with the app early in its development, and feedback was swiftly turned into feature additions and improvements for the following releases. The source code has been publicly available on GitHub since its inception, and contributions to further the capabilities of the app are always welcome. ThunderScout was installed on over a hundred devices during the beta period alone- so why not yours?
