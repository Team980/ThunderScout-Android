    <string name="update_notes">
        ThunderScout 2.0 redesigns the app\'s analytic features from the ground up to be more useful, relevant, and elegant.
        \n
        \nThe data analysis is now broken up into three tabs: Matches, Rankings, and Alliances.
        \n
        \nThe Matches tab displays a generated schedule of the event, allowing you to see at a glance all the data you have collected, or may be missing.
        \n
        \nThe Rankings tab ranks teams by an estimation of how many points they would score, on average, alone on the field based on your collected data.
        \n
        \nThe match and team breakdowns have been updated to highlight statistical performance and point estimations, and now take up less space.
        \n
        \nOther notable changes:
        \n&#8226; A "gears dropped" field has been added to auto and teleop.
        \n&#8226; The alliance field has been updated to reflect individual alliance stations.
        \n&#8226; The Bluetooth Device selection preference now opens a system dialog.
        \n&#8226; New squircle icon (now Adaptive on Android Oreo)
        \n&#8226; And don\'t forget this very dialog, which is also accessible in the About menu!
        \n
        \nThere are a lot of other under-the-hood changes as well.
        \n
        \nKnown issues:
        \n&#8226; The match schedule currently does not show when multiple matches occupy the same slot.
        \n&#8226; The Alliances menu is unimplemented.
        \n&#8226; The Feed has been removed and will be replaced with a similar feature in a future release.
        \n&#8226; The point calculations are untested. Please report any errors if you find them!
