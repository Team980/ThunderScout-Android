        Beta 2 adds a variable delay to client-side Bluetooth transmissions based on the data\'s AllianceStation. This should improve Bluetooth reliability.
        \n
        \nKnown issues:
        \n&#8226; The match schedule currently does not show when multiple matches occupy the same slot.
        \n&#8226; The Alliances menu is unimplemented.
        \n&#8226; The Feed has been removed and will be replaced with a similar feature in a future release.
        \n&#8226; The point calculations are untested. Please report any errors if you find them!
