        V15 has no release notes as of yet. Everything has changed.
        \nV14: Hotfix release: Fixed the bug that was causing all CSV imports to fail and crash the app.
        \n
        \nKnown issues:
        \n&#8226; The Bluetooth server may fail to receive matches logged as successfully sent by the client device.
        \n&#8226; The match schedule currently does not show when multiple matches occupy the same slot.
        \n&#8226; The Alliances menu is unimplemented.
        \n&#8226; The Feed has been removed and will be replaced with a similar feature in a future release.
        \n&#8226; The point calculations are untested. Please report any errors if you find them!
